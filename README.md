## Course description 

In this <b>Git</b> and <b>GitHub</b> course I learned the essentials to be comfortable with Git and GitHub. `Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. GitHub is the most popular hosting platform for software development and version control using Git. This course is split into Git tutorial and Git and GitHu.` -[Amigoscode](https://amigoscode.com/p/git-github)
